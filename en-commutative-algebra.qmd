## Rings and Ideals

### Rings and Ring Homomorphisms
:::{#def-ring}

## Ring

A ring $A$ is a set with two binary operations, usually called addition and multiplication, such that:

1. $(A, +)$ is an abelian group,

2. $(A, \cdot)$ is a semigroup,

3. Multiplication is distributive over addition: for all $a, b, c \in A$, $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$ and $(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c$.

4. Multiplication is commutative: for all $a, b \in A$, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$.

5. There exists a multiplicative identity $1 \in A$ such that for all $a \in A$, $a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a$.
:::

:::{#def-ringhom}

## Ring Homomorphism

A ring homomorphism is a mapping $f : A \to B$ between rings $A$ and $B$ such that for all $a, a' \in A$:

1. $f(a + a') = f(a) + f(a')$,

2. $f(a \cdot a') = f(a) \cdot f(a')$,

3. $f(1_A) = 1_B$.
:::

### Ideals and Quotient Rings

:::{#def-ideal}

## Ideal

An ideal $\ideala$ of a ring $A$ is a subset $\ideala \subseteq A$ such that:

1. $(\ideala, +)$ is a subgroup of $(A, +)$,

2. For all $a \in \ideala$ and $r \in A$, both $r a$ and $a r$ are in $\ideala$ (i.e., $\ideala$ is closed under multiplication by elements of $A$).
:::

:::{#def-quotient-ring}

## Quotient Ring

The quotient ring $A/\ideala$ is defined as follows: Let $A$ be a ring and $\ideala$ an ideal of $A$. The set of cosets

$$
A/\ideala = \{ a + \ideala \mid a \in A \}
$$

forms a ring with operations defined by

$$
(a + \ideala) + (b + \ideala) = (a + b) + \ideala, \quad (a + \ideala) \cdot (b + \ideala) = (a b) + \ideala.
$$

The natural projection $\pi: A \to A/\ideala$ given by $\pi(a) = a + \ideala$ is a surjective ring homomorphism with kernel $\ideala$.
:::

:::{#prp-ideals-corresponding}

## Correspondence of Ideals

Let $A$ be a ring and $\ideala \vartriangleleft A$ an ideal. There is a bijective correspondence between the set of ideals of $A$ containing $\ideala$ and the set of ideals of the quotient ring $A/\ideala$.

Explicitly, for each ideal $\idealb$ of $A$ with $\ideala \subseteq \idealb$, the image $\bar{\idealb} = \idealb/\ideala$ is an ideal of $A/\ideala$. Conversely, for each ideal $\bar{\idealb}$ of $A/\ideala$, its preimage under the natural projection $\pi: A \to A/\ideala$ is an ideal of $A$ containing $\ideala$.

This correspondence preserves inclusion, sums, intersections, and properties such as being prime or maximal (with suitable conditions).
$$
\{\idealb\vartriangleleft A \mid \ideala \subseteq \idealb\} \leftrightarrow \{\bar{\idealb}\vartriangleleft A/\ideala \}
$$
:::

:::{#def-kernel}

## Kernel

Let $f: A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism. The kernel of $f$, denoted $\ker f$, is the set

$$
\ker f = \{ a \in A \mid f(a) = 0_B \}
$$
where $0_B$ is the additive identity in $B$. The kernel $\ker f$ is an ideal of $A$.
:::

:::{#def-image}

## Image

Let $f: A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism. The image of $f$, denoted $\image f$, is the set

$$
\image f = \{ f(a) \mid a \in A \}
$$
which is a subring of $B$.
:::

### Zero-Divisors, Nilpotent Elements and Units

:::{#def-zero-divisor}

## Zero Divisor

Let $A$ be a ring. An element $a \in A$, $a \neq 0$, is called a **zero-divisor** if there exists a nonzero $b \in A$ such that $a b = 0$ or $b a = 0$.
:::

:::{#def-integral-domain}

## Integral Domain

A ring $A$ is called an **integral domain** if $A \neq \{0\}$ and $A$ has no zero-divisors; that is, for all $a, b \in A$, if $a b = 0$, then either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.
:::

:::{#def-nilpotent}

## Nilpotent

Let $A$ be a ring. An element $a \in A$ is called **nilpotent** if there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $a^n = 0$.
::: 

:::{#def-unit}

## Unit

An element $u \in A$ of a ring $A$ is called a **unit** if there exists $v \in A$ such that $u v = v u = 1$, where $1$ is the multiplicative identity in $A$. The set of all units in $A$ is denoted by $A^\times$.
::: 

:::{#def-principal-ideal}

## Principal Ideal

An ideal $\ideala$ of a ring $A$ is called a **principal ideal** if there exists an element $a \in A$ such that
$$
\ideala = (a) = \{ r a \mid r \in A \}.
$$
That is, $\ideala$ is generated by a single element $a$.
:::

:::{#prp-field}
Let $A\neq 0$ , then TFAE:

1. A is a field

2. the only ideals in $A$ are $(0)$ and $A(=(1))$.

3. $\forall f:A \to B\neq 0$ is injective.
:::

:::{.proof}
$(1)\implies (2)$ :
: Let $\ideala\vartriangleleft A$. If $\ideala\neq 0$, then $\exists x$ is a unit ,$x\in \ideala$

$(2)\implies (3)$ :
: The kernel $\ker f$ is either $\{0\}$ or $A$. If $\ker f = A$, then $f$ is the zero map, so $\image f = \{0\}$, contradicting $B \neq 0$. Thus, $\ker f = \{0\}$, so $f$ is injective.

$(3)\implies (1)$ :
: Let $x$ be not a unit. $(x)\neq (1)$. Let $B=A/(x)$, $f(x)=0\implies x=0$.
:::

### Prime Ideals and Maximal Ideals

:::{#def-prime-ideal}

## Prime Ideal

An ideal $\idealp$ in $A$ is prime if $\idealp\neq(1)$ and if $xy\in \idealp\implies x\in \idealp \text{ or } y\in \idealp$.
:::

:::{#def-maximal-ideal}

## Maximal Ideal

An ideal $\idealm$ in $A$ is maximal if $\idealm\neq(1)$ and there is no ideal $\ideala$ s.t. $\idealm\subsetneq\ideala\subsetneq(1)$.
:::

:::{#prp-prime-ideal-prop}
1. $\idealp$ is prime ideal $\Leftrightarrow$ $A/\idealp$ is integral domain.
2. $\idealm$ is maximal ideal $\Leftrightarrow$ $A/\idealm$ is field. Hence maximal ideals are prime.
3. Let $f:A\to B$ is ring homomorphism. $\idealp$ is a prime ideal in $B$, then $f^{-1}(\idealp)$ is prime in $A$.
:::

:::{.proof}
$(1)(2)$ :
: Omitted. cf.[@聂灵沼2021代数学引论 {Ch.3, Sec.4, p.110, thm.7, thm.8}]

$(3)$ :
: You can consider the preimage $f^{-1}(\idealp) = \{ a \in A \mid f(a) \in \idealp \}$. If $xy \in f^{-1}(\idealp)$, then $f(xy) = f(x)f(y) \in \idealp$. Since $\idealp$ is prime, $f(x) \in \idealp$ or $f(y) \in \idealp$, so $x \in f^{-1}(\idealp)$ or $y \in f^{-1}(\idealp)$.

In particular, you can consider $A/f^{-1}(\idealp)\cong B/\idealp$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that if $\idealm \vartriangleleft B$ is maximal, then $f^{-1}(\idealm)$ is a maximal ideal of $A$ if $f$ is surjective. In general, the preimage of a maximal ideal under a ring homomorphism need not be maximal unless the map is surjective.

Let $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q}$ be the natural embedding, $\idealm=(0)$. $\mathbb{Q}$ is a field, $\idealm$ is maximal, but its preimage $f^{-1}(\idealm)=(0)$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ is properly contained in $(p)$, for any $p\in \mathbb{N}$.
:::

:::{#lem-Zorn}

## Zorn's lemma

Let $S$ be a non-empty partially ordered set such that every chain (i.e., totally ordered subset) in $S$ has an upper bound in $S$. Then $S$ contains at least one maximal element; that is, there exists $m \in S$ such that if $m \leq s$ for some $s \in S$, then $m = s$.
:::

:::{#thm-maximal-ideal}

## Existence of Maximal Ideals

Every nonzero ring $A$ with $1$ has at least one maximal ideal.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $S$ be the set of all proper ideals of $A$, partially ordered by inclusion. $S$ is nonempty since $(0)$ is a proper ideal (as $A \neq 0$). Any chain of ideals in $S$ has an upper bound given by the union of the chain, which is again a proper ideal. By Zorn's Lemma, $S$ has a maximal element, which is a maximal ideal of $A$.
:::

:::{#cor-maximal1}
## Every Ideal is Contained in a Maximal Ideal

If $\ideala$ be a proper ideal of $A$, then $\exists \idealm$ is maximal, s.t. $\ideala \subseteq \idealm$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $\ideala$ be a proper ideal of $A$ (i.e., $\ideala \neq (1)$). Consider the quotient ring $A/\ideala$. By the existence of maximal ideals, $A/\ideala$ has a maximal ideal $\bar{\idealm}$. The preimage $\idealm = \pi^{-1}(\bar{\idealm})$ under the natural projection $\pi: A \to A/\ideala$ is a maximal ideal of $A$ containing $\ideala$.
:::

:::{#cor-maximal2}
## Every Non-Unit is Contained in a Maximal Ideal

Every non-unit element of $A$ is contained in some maximal ideal of $A$.
Let $a \in A$ be a non-unit. Then the ideal $(a)$ generated by $a$ is a proper ideal, i.e., $(a) \neq (1)$. By the previous corollary, there exists a maximal ideal $\idealm$ such that $(a) \subseteq \idealm$. Thus, $a \in \idealm$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $S$ be the set of all proper ideals of $A$, partially ordered by inclusion. $S$ is nonempty since $(0)$ is a proper ideal (as $A \neq 0$). Any chain of ideals in $S$ has an upper bound given by the union of the chain, which is again a proper ideal. By Zorn's Lemma, $S$ has a maximal element, which is a maximal ideal of $A$.
:::

:::{#def-local-ring}
## Local Ring

A ring $A$ is called a **local ring** if it has a unique maximal ideal $\idealm$. That is, there exists exactly one maximal ideal in $A$.
:::

:::{#def-residue-field}
## Residue Field

Let $A$ be a local ring with unique maximal ideal $\idealm$. The **residue field** of $A$ is the quotient ring
$$
k = A/\idealm
$$
which is a field. The natural projection $A \to k$ is called the **residue map**.
:::

:::{#prp-local-ring-prp}
1. Let $A$ be a ring and $\idealm\neq(1)$, s.t. $\forall x \in A\setminus\idealm$ is a unit. Then $A$ is a local ring, and $\idealm$ is maximal.

2. Let $A$ be a ring and $\idealm$ maximal ideal of $A$, s.t. $1+\idealm$ is a unit of $A$. Then $A$ is a local ring.
:::

:::{.proof}
$(1)$ :
: Every non-unit is contained in $\idealm$. Hence $\idealm$ is the only maximal ideal.

$(2)$ :
: $\forall \ideal{n}\vartriangleleft A$. If $\ideal{n}\not\subseteq\idealm$, take $x\in \ideal{n}\setminus\idealm$. $(x)+\idealm=(1)$. $\exists y\in A, m\in \idealm, xy+m=1 \implies xy=1-m$ is a unit. Then $\ideal{n}=(1)$. Contradiction!
:::

:::{#def-semi-local}
## Semi-local Ring

A ring $A$ is called **semi-local** if $A$ has only finitely many maximal ideals.
:::

:::{#def-pid}

## PID

An integral domain $A$ is called a **principal ideal domain (PID)** if every ideal of $A$ is principal; that is, for every ideal $\ideala \subseteq A$, there exists $a \in A$ such that $\ideala = (a) = \{ r a \mid r \in A \}$.
:::

:::{#prp-pid}
In PID, $\ideala$ is prime $\Leftrightarrow$ $\ideala$ is maximal.
:::

:::{.proof}
If $(x)\neq(1)$ is prime. Let $(x)\subsetneq(y)$. Then $x\in(y)\implies \exists z$ s.t. $x=yz$. 
$y\not\in(x)\implies z\in (x)\implies \exists t,\ \text{s.t. } z=xt.$$
:::

### Nilradical and Jacobson Radical

:::{#prp-nil}
1. The set $\nilrad$ of all nilpotent elements of $A$ is an ideal.
$$
\nilrad = \{ a \in A \mid a \text{ is nilpotent} \}
$$
2. And $A/\nilrad$ has no non-zero nilpotent element.
:::

:::{.proof}
$(1)$ :
: If $x\in\nilrad$, then $ax\in \nilrad,\  \text{for}\ \forall\ a\in A$. $\forall x,\ y\in\nilrad,\ \exists m,\ n,\ x^m=y^n=0$, then 
$$
(x+y)^{m+n-1}=0\implies x+y\in \nilrad.
$$

$(2)$ :
: If $\bar{x}^n=0$, $x^n\in \nilrad\implies \exists k,\  x^{nk}=0\implies x\in\nilrad\implies\bar{x}=0$.
:::


:::{#def-nilradical} 
## Nilradical

The set $\nilrad$ is called **Nilradical** of $A$.
:::


:::{#prp-nilradical}
The nilradical $\nilrad$ of a ring $A$ is equal to the intersection of all prime ideals of $A$

That is, an element $a \in A$ is nilpotent if and only if $a$ belongs to every prime ideal of $A$.

Let
$$
\nilrad' = \bigcap_{\idealp \text{ prime}} \idealp
$$
We need to show $\nilrad=\nilrad'$
:::

:::{.proof}
$(\nilrad \subseteq \nilrad')$ :
: If $x\in \nilrad$, then $x^n=0\in \idealp$ for any $\idealp$. It implies $x\in \idealp$ for any $\idealp$.

$(\nilrad' \subseteq \nilrad)$ :
: Suppose $\forall n>0$, $x^n\neq0$. Let
$$
\Sigma=\{\ideala\vartriangleleft A \mid x^n\not\in\ideala, \forall n>0\}.
$$
Let $T$ be a totally ordered chain in $\Sigma$. Consider $\ideala_T = \bigcup_{\ideala \in T} \ideala$. We claim that $\ideala_T \in \Sigma$.

- $\ideala_T$ is an ideal: Since $T$ is a chain, the union of the ideals in $T$ is again an ideal.
- For all $n > 0$, if $x^n \in \ideala_T$, then $x^n \in \ideala$ for some $\ideala \in T$, contradicting the definition of $\Sigma$.

Thus, every chain in $\Sigma$ has an upper bound, so by Zorn's Lemma, $\Sigma$ has a maximal element, say $\idealp$. We claim that $\idealp$ is a prime ideal.

Suppose $a, b \notin \idealp$. Then the ideals $\ideala_1 = \idealp + (a)$ and $\ideala_2 = \idealp + (b)$ strictly contain $\idealp$, so by maximality, there exist $n_1, n_2 > 0$ such that $x^{n_1} \in \ideala_1$ and $x^{n_2} \in \ideala_2$. Thus,
$$
x^{n_1} = y_1 + a z_1, \quad x^{n_2} = y_2 + b z_2
$$
for some $y_1, y_2 \in \idealp$, $z_1, z_2 \in A$. Then
$$
x^{n_1 + n_2} = (x^{n_1})(x^{n_2}) = (y_1 + a z_1)(y_2 + b z_2)
$$
Expanding and using that $\idealp$ is an ideal, all terms except $a b z_1 z_2$ are in $\idealp$, so
$$
x^{n_1 + n_2} - a b z_1 z_2 \in \idealp \implies x^{n_1 + n_2} \in \idealp + (a b)
$$
Thus, $x^{n_1 + n_2} \in \idealp + (a b)$, so by maximality, $x^m \in \idealp + (a b)$ for some $m > 0$, but $x^m \notin \idealp$ by construction, so $a b \notin \idealp$.

Therefore, $\idealp$ is a prime ideal not containing any power of $x$, contradicting $x \in \bigcap_{\idealp \text{ prime}} \idealp$. Thus, $\nilrad = \nilrad'$.
:::

:::{#def-jacobson-radical}
## Jacobson Radical
Let $\jacobson$ be the intersection of all maximal ideals of $A$:
$$
\jacobson = \bigcap_{\idealm \text{ maximal}} \idealm
$$
This ideal is called the **Jacobson radical** of $A$.
:::

:::{#prp-jacobson}
$x\in\jacobson\Leftrightarrow 1-xy$ is a unit in $A$ for all $y\in A$
:::

:::{.proof}
$(\implies)$: 
Suppose $x \in \jacobson$, but $1 - x y$ is not a unit for some $y \in A$. Then the ideal $(1 - x y)$ is proper, so it is contained in some maximal ideal $\idealm$. Thus, $1 - x y \in \idealm$. But $x \in \jacobson \subseteq \idealm$, so $x y \in \idealm$, hence $1 = (1 - x y) + x y \in \idealm$, which is impossible since $\idealm$ is proper. Therefore, $1 - x y$ must be a unit for all $y \in A$.

$(\Longleftarrow)$ :
: 
Suppose $x \notin \idealm$ for some maximal ideal $\idealm$. Then the ideal generated by $x$ and $\idealm$ is the whole ring: $(x) + \idealm = (1)$. This means there exist $y \in A$ and $t \in \idealm$ such that $x y + t = 1$, or equivalently, $1 - x y = t \in \idealm$. Since $\idealm$ is maximal, $1 - x y$ is not a unit only if it lies in some maximal ideal, but by assumption $x \notin \idealm$, so $1 - x y$ cannot be non-invertible. Therefore, if $1 - x y$ is a unit for all $y \in A$, then $x$ must be contained in every maximal ideal, i.e., $x \in \jacobson$.
:::

### Operations on Arbitrary Families of Ideals

Let $\{\ideala_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of ideals in a ring $A$.

:::{#def-ideal-sum-general}
## Sum of  Ideals

The **sum** $\sum_{i\in I} \ideala_i$ is defined as:
$$
\sum_{i\in I} \ideala_i = \left\{ a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n \mid a_k \in \ideala_{i_k},\; i_k \in I,\; n \geq 1 \right\}
$$
:::

:::{#def-ideal-product-general}
## Intersection of Ideals

The **product** $\prod_{i\in I} \ideala_i$ is defined as:
$$
\prod_{i\in I} \ideala_i = \left\{ \sum_{k=1}^m a_{1,k} \cdots a_{n,k} \mid a_{j,k} \in \ideala_j,\; m \geq 1 \right\}
$$
(For infinite families, the product is usually defined only for finite subfamilies.)
:::

:::{#def-ideal-intersection-general}
## Product of Ideals

The **intersection** $\bigcap_{i\in I} \ideala_i$ is defined as:
$$
\bigcap_{i\in I} \ideala_i = \{ a \in A \mid a \in \ideala_i \text{ for all } i \in I \}
$$
:::

:::{prp-operation}
1. Distributive law: 
$$
\ideala(\idealb+i\ideal{c})=\ideala\idealb+\ideala\ideal{c}
$$

2. Modular law: 
$$
\ideala\cap(\idealb+\ideal{c})=\ideala\cap\idealb+\ideala\cap\ideal{c}, \text{if } \ideala \supseteq \idealb \text{or } \ideala \supseteq \ideal{c}
$$
In general, we have ${\ideala+\idealb}(\ideala\cap\idealb)\subseteq\ideala\idealb$. Clearly,$\ideala\idealb\subseteq\ideala\cap\idealb$, hence $\ideala\cap\idealb=\ideala\idealb$ provided $\ideala +\idealb=(1)$.

:::

:::{#def-coprime}
## Coprime
Let $\ideala, \idealb$ be ideals of $A$. We call $\ideala, \idealb$ are coprime, when $\ideala+\idealb=A$.
:::

:::{#def-direct-product}
## Direct Product of Rings

Let $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of rings. The **direct product** $\prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is defined as
$$
\prod_{i \in I} A_i := \left\{ (x_i)_{i \in I} \mid x_i \in A_i \text{ for all } i \in I \right\}
$$
with addition and multiplication defined componentwise:
$$
(x_i) + (y_i) = (x_i + y_i), \quad (x_i) \cdot (y_i) = (x_i y_i)
$$
for all $(x_i), (y_i) \in \prod_{i \in I} A_i$.

Let $A_i$ be rings, and let $p_i : \prod_{j \in I} A_j \to A_i$ be the projection onto the $i$-th component, defined by $p_i((x_j)_{j \in I}) = x_i$.
:::

:::{#def-chinese-remainder-map}
## Chinese Remainder Map

Let $\{\ideala_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a family of ideals of $A$. Define the canonical ring homomorphism
$$
\Phi: A \to \prod_{i \in I} A/\ideala_i, \quad a \mapsto (a + \ideala_i)_{i \in I}
$$
where each component is the natural projection $\phi_i : A \to A/\ideala_i$, $a \mapsto a + \ideala_i$.

This map $\Phi$ is a ring homomorphism, called the **Chinese Remainder map** associated to the family $\{\ideala_i\}$.
:::

:::{#prp-chinese-remainder-prp}
Let $\{\ideala_i\}_{i=1}^n$ be a family of ideals of $A$.

1. $\forall i\neq j$, $\ideala_i, \ideala_j$ are coprime, then $\prod_{i=1}^n\ideala_i=\bigcap_{i=1}^n\ideala_i$.

2. $\phi$ is surjective $\Leftrightarrow$ $\ideala_i, \ideala_j$ are coprime.

3. $\phi$ is injective $\Leftrightarrow$ $\bigcap_{i=1}^n\ideala_i=0$.
:::

:::{.proof}
Omitted. cf.[@atiyah2018introduction {ch.1, sec.6, p.7, prop.1.10}].
:::

:::{#thm-chinese-remainder-thm}
## Chinese Remainder Theorem

Let $A$ be a ring and $\ideala_1, \ldots, \ideala_n$ be ideals of $A$ such that $\ideala_i + \ideala_j = (1)$ for all $i \neq j$ (i.e., the ideals are pairwise coprime). Then the canonical map
$$
\Phi: A \to \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i, \quad a \mapsto (a + \ideala_1, \ldots, a + \ideala_n)
$$
is surjective, and its kernel is $\bigcap_{i=1}^n \ideala_i$. Thus,
$$
A / \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \ideala_i \right) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i
$$
as rings.

In particular, if $A = \mathbb{Z}$ and the $\ideala_i = (n_i)$ with $\gcd(n_i, n_j) = 1$ for $i \neq j$, then
$$
\mathbb{Z}/(n_1 n_2 \cdots n_k) \cong \mathbb{Z}/n_1 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}/n_k.
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
Let $\Phi: A \to \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i$ be the canonical map, $a \mapsto (a+\ideala_1, \ldots, a+\ideala_n)$. 

- **Kernel:** $\ker \Phi = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \ideala_i$, since $a \in \ker \Phi$ iff $a \in \ideala_i$ for all $i$.

- **Surjectivity:** For any $(b_1+\ideala_1, \ldots, b_n+\ideala_n) \in \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i$, we want $a \in A$ such that $a \equiv b_i \pmod{\ideala_i}$ for all $i$.

Since the ideals are pairwise coprime, for each $i$ there exists $e_i \in A$ such that $e_i \equiv 1 \pmod{\ideala_i}$ and $e_i \equiv 0 \pmod{\ideala_j}$ for $j \neq i$. (This follows from the Chinese Remainder construction: for each $i$, let $J_i = \bigcap_{j \neq i} \ideala_j$, then $J_i + \ideala_i = (1)$, so $1 = x_i + y_i$ with $x_i \in J_i$, $y_i \in \ideala_i$; set $e_i = x_i$.)

Then set $a = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i e_i$. For each $k$, $a \equiv b_k e_k \equiv b_k \pmod{\ideala_k}$, since $e_k \equiv 1 \pmod{\ideala_k}$ and $e_i \equiv 0 \pmod{\ideala_k}$ for $i \neq k$.

Thus, $\Phi$ is surjective.

- **Isomorphism:** By the First Isomorphism Theorem, $A/\ker\Phi \cong \operatorname{Im}\Phi = \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i$.

Therefore,
$$
A / \left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \ideala_i \right) \cong \prod_{i=1}^n A/\ideala_i.
$$
:::

:::{.remark}
The union of ideals is not necessarily an ideal unless one contain the others.

In general, the union $\ideala \cup \idealb$ fails to be closed under addition. For example, in $\mathbb{Z}$, the ideals $(2)$ and $(3)$ have union $\{ \ldots, -6, -4, -3, -2, 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, \ldots \}$, but $2 \in (2)$ and $3 \in (3)$, yet $2 + 3 = 5 \notin (2) \cup (3)$.

$$\rad(\ideala)=\bigcap_{\idealp\supseteq\ideala \ \text{prime}}\idealp$$.

**Hint:** Consider nilradical of the quotient ring $A/\ideala$, and the corresponding of ideals.
:::

:::{.proof}
## Proof.1

Let $\pi: A \to A/\ideala$ be the canonical projection. By the Correspondence Theorem, there is a bijection between the set of prime ideals of $A$ containing $\ideala$ and the set of prime ideals of $A/\ideala$.

The nilradical of $A/\ideala$, denoted $\nilrad(A/\ideala)$, is the intersection of all prime ideals of $A/\ideala$:
$$
\nilrad(A/\ideala) = \bigcap_{\bar{\idealp} \text{ prime in } A/\ideala} \bar{\idealp}
$$
The preimage of this intersection under $\pi$ is the intersection of all prime ideals of $A$ containing $\ideala$:
$$
\pi^{-1}(\nilrad(A/\ideala)) = \bigcap_{\idealp \supseteq \ideala,\ \idealp \text{ prime}} \idealp
$$

On the other hand, $\nilrad(A/\ideala)$ consists of all elements $\bar{x} = x + \ideala$ such that $(x + \ideala)^n = \ideala$ for some $n \geq 1$, i.e., $x^n \in \ideala$. Thus,
$$
\pi^{-1}(\nilrad(A/\ideala)) = \{ x \in A \mid x^n \in \ideala \text{ for some } n \geq 1 \} = \rad(\ideala)
$$

Therefore,
$$
\rad(\ideala) = \bigcap_{\idealp \supseteq \ideala,\ \idealp \text{ prime}} \idealp
$$
:::

:::{.proof}
## Proof.2

Let $x \in \rad(\ideala)$. Then $x^n \in \ideala$ for some $n > 0$. For any prime ideal $\idealp \supseteq \ideala$, since $\idealp$ is prime and $x^n \in \idealp$, it follows that $x \in \idealp$. Thus, $x$ is in every prime ideal containing $\ideala$, so $x \in \bigcap_{\idealp \supseteq \ideala\ \text{prime}} \idealp$.

Conversely, suppose $x \notin \rad(\ideala)$. Then $x^n \notin \ideala$ for all $n > 0$. Consider the quotient ring $A/\ideala$ and the image $\bar{x}$ of $x$. Then $\bar{x}^n \neq 0$ for all $n > 0$. By the proof of the nilradical as intersection of primes, there exists a prime ideal $\bar{\idealp}$ of $A/\ideala$ not containing any power of $\bar{x}$. The preimage $\idealp$ of $\bar{\idealp}$ under the projection $A \to A/\ideala$ is a prime ideal of $A$ containing $\ideala$ but not $x$. Thus, $x \notin \bigcap_{\idealp \supseteq \ideala\ \text{prime}} \idealp$.

Therefore, $\rad(\ideala) = \bigcap_{\idealp \supseteq \ideala\ \text{prime}} \idealp$.

4. The set $C=\{\ideala^e\mid \ideala \vartriangleleft A\}$, and $E=\{\idealb^c\mid \idealb \vartriangleleft B\}$, then $C=\{\ideala\mid \ideala^{ec}=\ideala\}$, and $E=\{\idealb\mid \idealb^{ce}=\idealb\}$.

5. There is a correspondence between ideals of $A$ and ideals of $B$ that are stable under extension and contraction, i.e., there is a bijective between $E$ and $C$.

6. If $f$ is surjective, then every ideal of $B$ is the extension of its contraction.

7. The contraction of a prime ideal of $B$ is a prime ideal of $A$.

8. The extension of a prime ideal of $A$ need not be prime in $B$.

- If $\ideala$ is the ideal generated by $E$, $V(E)=V(\ideala)=V(\rad(\ideala))$. 
- $V(0) = \spec A$; $V(1) = \varnothing$.
- $V\left(\bigcup_{\alpha} \ideala_\alpha\right) = \bigcap_{\alpha} V(\ideala_\alpha)$.

1. The set $\{x\}$ is closed in $\spec A$ $\Leftrightarrow$ $\idealp$ is maximal.

2. $\overline{\{x\}}=V{\idealp _x}$.

3. $y\in\overline{\{x\}}\Leftrightarrow\idealp _x\subseteq\idealp _y$

2. If $Y$ is an irreducible subspace of $X$, then the closure $\overline{Y}$ of $Y$ in $X$ is irreducible.

3. Every irreducible subspace of $X$ is contained in a maximal irreducible subspace.

4. The maximal irreducible subspaces of $X$ are closed and cover $X$. They are called the **irreducible components** of $X$.

5. The irreducible components of $\spec A$ are the closed sets $V(\idealp)$, where $\idealp$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$.

### Affine Algebraic Varieties

Let $k$ be a field. An **affine algebraic variety** over $k$ is a subset $V \subseteq k^n$ defined as the common zeros of a set of polynomials:
$$
V = V(S) = \{\, x \in k^n \mid f(x) = 0\ \forall f \in S \,\}
$$
for some subset $S \subseteq k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$.

The set of all polynomials vanishing on $V$ is an ideal:
$$
I(V) = \{\, f \in k[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \mid f(x) = 0\ \forall x \in V \,\}
$$

There is a correspondence between affine varieties and radical ideals of $k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ (Hilbert's Nullstellensatz).

The coordinate ring of $V$ is defined as
$$
k[V] = k[x_1, \ldots, x_n]/I(V)
$$
which encodes the algebraic structure of $V$.

But $1 + a$ is a unit in $A$ (since $a \in \jacobson$ and [@prp-jacobson]). Therefore, $x$ is invertible, so $x M = 0$ implies $M = 0$.

Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module, $N$ is a submodule of $M$, $\ideala\vartriangleleft A$, if $\ideala \subseteq \jacobson$, then $M=\ideala M+N$ implies $N=M$.

:::{.proof}
Consider the quotient module $M/N$. Since $M = \ideala M + N$, we have
$$
M/N = (\ideala M + N)/N \cong \ideala M / (\ideala M \cap N) \subseteq \ideala (M/N)
$$
so $M/N = \ideala (M/N)$. By [@thm-nakayama-lemma], since $\ideala \subseteq \jacobson$ and $M/N$ is finitely generated, it follows that $M/N = 0$, i.e., $M = N$.
